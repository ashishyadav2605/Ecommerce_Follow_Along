# Ecommerce-Follow-Along
'E-commerce website'  follow along project for Semester 2

***Milestone 1***: **Project Overview**

In todays live session our mentor introduced us to overall structure of MERN Stack.
He taught us the foundational steps to set up the environment for future milestones, we created a new repository for our follow along project.

***Milestone 2***: **Front-end setup and login page**

In todays live session we learnt to organize the files into separate frontend and backend directories.

Set up React for frontend

Node.js setup for backend

Tailwind CSS configurations

We also designed the front end for login page of the e-commerce application.


***Milestone 3***: **File organizing and MongoDB**

Set up dedicated folders for organizing backend code effectively.
Initialize and configure a Node.js server to handle API requests.
Connect your application to MongoDB to store and manage data.
Implement basic error handling to ensure your server runs smoothly.

***Milestone 4***: **Created and Configured Files**

Created a User Model: Our mentor explained how a MODEL in MVC architecture works and how it interacts with database.
Created a User Controller: We got to know the purpose of a controller in MVC.
Enable and Configure Multer: In the live session mentor told us what is a multer and what is it used for and how it can be configured to handle file uploads.

***Milestone 5***: **Created Frontend UI for signup page and added the code for authentication of the inputs**

In this part of the Follow Along project we made the UI (Frontend) for the sign up page of our website. This page allows the users to add their details.

After the user is done with entering backend comes into play. Backend does the form validation part, it verifies whether the user has entered the details in the right format(e.g. email, minimum length)

***Milestone 6***: 

1. Encrypt the Password Using bcrypt

During the user signup process, encrypt the user's password using the bcrypt hashing algorithm. This ensures that the password is stored in a secure, non-reversible format.
The bcrypt algorithm adds a "salt" to the password before hashing, making it resistant to common password-cracking techniques.
The hashed password should never be stored in plain text.

2. Save the Hashed Password in the Database

Only store the hashed version of the password in the database.
Do not store plain text passwords for security reasons.
Ensure the hashed password is securely saved in the database along with other user information.

3. Store Complete User Data

In addition to the hashed password, save the user's other information, such as their name, email, and any other relevant data.
The complete user data should be stored securely, ensuring that sensitive information like the password remains encrypted.

4. Handle Login with Hashed Passwords

During the login process, compare the entered password with the hashed version stored in the database.
Use bcrypt to safely verify if the entered password matches the stored hash.

**Milestone 7**
1. Create Login Endpoint:

**Milestone 7**

1. Create Login Endpoint:

Accept user credentials (email/username and password).
Retrieve the corresponding user from the database.

2. Validate Password:

Use bcrypt to hash the entered password.
Compare it with the stored hashed password for authentication.


**Milestone 8**
1. Create the Card Component:

Design a reusable card component with props for product details (e.g., name, image, price).

2. Design the Homepage Layout:

Set up a grid layout or flexbox for displaying multiple cards neatly.

**Milestone 9**

1. Create the form for products

2. This form will take multiple product images images as input

**Milestone 10**

1. Define the structure of product data (e.g., name, description, price, image URL) using Mongoose. -Ensure each field has proper validation (e.g., required fields, correct data types).

2. Build a POST endpoint to receive product data.

3. Validate and save the product details to MongoDB.

Use bcrypt to hash the entered password.
Compare it with the stored hashed password for authentication.
